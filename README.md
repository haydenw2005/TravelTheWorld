# TravelTheWorld
TravelTheWorld is a website that allows you to explore countries across the globe and create a wishlist of the places you have always wanted to visit.

## Technology
TravelTheWorld is a full-stack website that uses JS, Flask, and SQL to provide a responsive and seamless user experience. Using the MapBox and RestCountries API, users can search countries and their facts, then pin locations to their personal maps. Users can delete these countries or add more whenever by making backend AJAX calls and updating their map within seconds. The website also uses password hashing and SQL injection protection to create a secure user experience. 

## Current Status
TravelTheWorld is currently down. In the near future, I hope to host the domain again.
